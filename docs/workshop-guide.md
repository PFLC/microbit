## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**For Advanced Students:**
- Provide extension challenges
- Encourage helping peers
- Introduce advanced concepts
- Suggest complex projects

**For Struggling Students:**
- Pair with stronger peer
- Break tasks into smaller steps
- Provide more scaffolding
- Use visual aids
- Allow more time

**For Various Ages:**
- 7-9 years: MakeCode blocks, simple projects
- 10-12 years: Mix of blocks and Python
- 13+ years: Focus on Python, advanced concepts

### Pair Programming

Benefits:
- Reduces equipment needs
- Encourages collaboration
- Peer learning
- Builds communication skills

Roles:
- **Driver**: Controls keyboard/mouse, implements code
- **Navigator**: Guides, spots errors, suggests solutions
- Switch roles regularly (every 10-15 minutes)

### Common Challenges

#### "My micro:bit isn't working!"
1. Check USB cable connection
2. Try different USB port
3. Check MICROBIT drive appears
4. Reset micro:bit
5. Try different cable
6. Use backup micro:bit if needed

#### "I don't understand the code!"
1. Break it down line by line
2. Use analogies and real-world examples
3. Have them explain it back to you
4. Use the simulator to visualize
5. Draw diagrams

#### "It's too easy/hard!"
1. Adjust difficulty level
2. Provide appropriate challenges
3. Group similar-ability students
4. Have extension activities ready
5. Differentiate instruction

## Classroom Management

### Assessment Rubric Example

| Criteria | Beginning | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| Understanding | Needs help | Some concepts | Most concepts | All concepts + extensions |
| Code Quality | Errors, doesn't run | Runs with help | Runs independently | Optimized, well-commented |
| Problem Solving | Gives up easily | Tries, needs guidance | Persists, seeks help | Independent, helps others |
| Creativity | Copies exactly | Minor changes | Personalization | Original ideas |

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Drive doesn't appear | Check cable, try different port |
| Program doesn't run | Re-download, check for errors |
| Display not working | Check code, verify LEDs working |
| Button unresponsive | Check code, test button physically |
| Slow upload | Large file, wait patiently |

### Emergency Backup Plans

1. **Internet Down**
